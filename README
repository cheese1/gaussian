To install this module into XScreenSaver:

1. Download the source for XScreenSaver from
http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/

2. Copy the line referring to "gaussian" from driver/XScreenSaver.ad.in to
   the same file in the XScreenSaver distribution.

3. Copy all references to gaussian from hacks/Makefile.in to the same file
   in the XScreenSaver distribution.  You may have to change the build
   command, since this often changes from one version to the next.  Check
   to see what other build commands look like in the version of
   XScreenSaver that you downloaded.

4. Copy hacks/gaussian.c, hacks/gaussian.man, and hacks/config/gaussian.xml
   into the XScreenSaver source tree.

5. Build XScreenSaver:  ./configure; make

6. Either install XScreenSaver from the source distribution (make install) or:

  a. Copy the gaussian binary to wherever XScreenSaver's modules are
     stored, e.g., /usr/libexec/xscreensaver/ or
     /usr/local/libexec/xscreensaver/

  b. Copy hacks/config/gaussian.xml to wherever XScreenSaver's
     configurations are stored, e.g., /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/ or
     /usr/local/share/xscreensaver/config/

  b. Apply the patch from XScreenSaver.ad.in to ~/.xscreensaver so it can
     find the gaussian binary.

7. Ask Jamie Zawinski (jwz@jwz.org) to include it in the distribution so
   you don't have to do this again!
